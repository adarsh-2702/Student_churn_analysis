# Student_churn_analysis
This project involved developing an 

AI-Powered Student Retention and Engagement System leveraging predictive analytics and machine learning to address high dropout rates in education technology (EdTech) platforms.



The primary goal was to transform raw educational data into 

actionable strategies to boost program completion and optimize engagement.



Key Project Components & Outcomes
1. Predictive Churn Analysis
The project utilized machine learning models to identify and predict students at risk of dropping out.


Best Model: A Random Forest model was selected as the best performer, achieving approximately 79% accuracy in predicting student churn.


Top Predictors: The analysis highlighted key factors correlating with dropout risk:

Program duration 

exceeding 1 year.



A significant 

delay between signup and start.


Certain demographic factors (e.g., older learners were less likely to complete).

2. Personalized Recommendation System
A system was designed to personalize the learning experience and provide proactive support.



Algorithm: A content-based filtering recommendation system was developed.






Functionality: The system suggests opportunities similar to courses previously completed and is designed to trigger interventions (e.g., automated reminders, mentor check-ins) for inactive or at-risk learners flagged by the predictive model.




3. Actionable Insights & Recommendations
The analysis provided data-driven recommendations for improving retention.



Modular Programs: Recommended converting long-term opportunities into shorter, modular chunks (30-60 days) to improve completion rates.



Targeted Alerts: Recommended using the predictive models to implement AI-driven alerts for early intervention with at-risk learners.

Tools & Technologies Used

Core Libraries: Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn).



Data Management: SQL for data handling and backend integration.



Visualization: Power BI and Tableau for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and real-time dashboards.
